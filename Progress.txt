02/07/2025. 1. Used npm create vite@latest and added a frontend using react

04/07/2025. I added an aminoacid display. I fetched the amino acids from the server and got the json objects back
            I used these to display a list of the Amino acids. 
            I need to go back to my CSS skills to make cards of the aminoacids I'm displaying. This is the next task
